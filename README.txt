⚙️ Requirements:
	install tkinter and sqlite3
	
⚙️ How to use:
	Run the "GUI_database.py" program in folder where is the database (that you want to view) stored
	
❗ This program can do only "SELECT * FROM <table_name>" so far, further upgrades and updates comming soon.

❗ I RECOMMEND not to open complex databases, the program has no limit for SELECT *, so if you have database with XXX millions of data, this program is not adapted for it so far.
